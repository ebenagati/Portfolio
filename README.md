### Beyond the Myths: A Data-Driven Analysis of Common Myths in Football
**Aim:** <br/>
To investigate whether 2-0 is a dangerous scoreline and to understand whether there is really an advantage playing at home.<br/><br/>
**Description:** <br/>
This project explores two popular football beliefs: the 'dangerous' nature of a 2-0 scoreline and the concept of home-field advantage. Using data from the last 10 seasons within the Premier League, I aim to uncover the accuracy of these assumptions through data analysis. The analysis of the 2-0 scoreline is primarily completed within Python while the analysis of home field advantage is completed within Power BI. <br/><br/>
**Technology Stack:**<br/>
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Excel, Power BI <br/><br/>
**Key Insights:** <br/>
The data shows that when a team is winning 2-0 at halftime they are overwhelmingly likely to win the game - 93.4% and 89.18% respectively for Home and Away teams.<br />
This indicates that 2-0 is not a dangerous scoreline as leading teams are very likely to finish the game with a win<br/><br/>
Based on the following metrics: Win Rate, % of total goals scored at Home vs Away, Home Expected Goals vs Away Expected Goals, Home Shots vs Away Shots & Home Shots on Target vs Away Shots on Target.<br/>
A team statistically performs better at home.<br/>
