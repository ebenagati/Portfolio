## About Me

Hello all, my name is Eben Agati - welcome to my portfolio!<br/><br/>
I studied Economics at the University of Nottingham, once I graduated, I worked in External Audit for approximately 18 months.<br/> After my stint as an auditor I transitioned to a Business Analyst role to which I have been working in the world of Business Analysis since.<br/>
Throughout my career I have always loved the data analysis segments of my roles therefore I have decided to create this portfolio in order to showcase my skills, improve my skillset and to derive interesting insights about topics that I love.

## Projects
Within this section, you can find a brief explanation of each project I have worked on along with the technology stack used.

### Beyond the Myths: A Data-Driven Analysis of Common Myths in Football
**Aim:** <br/>
To investigate whether 2-0 is a dangerous scoreline and to understand whether there is really an advantage playing at home.<br/><br/>
**Description:** <br/>
This project explores two popular football beliefs: the 'dangerous' nature of a 2-0 scoreline and the concept of home-field advantage. Using data from the last 10 seasons within the Premier League, I aim to uncover the accuracy of these assumptions through data analysis. The analysis of the 2-0 scoreline is primarily completed within Python while the analysis of home field advantage is completed within Power BI. <br/><br/>
**Technology Stack:**<br/>
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Excel, Power BI <br/><br/>
**Key Insights:** <br/>
The data shows that when a team is winning 2-0 at halftime they are overwhelmingly likely to win the game - 93.4% and 89.18% respectively for Home and Away teams.<br />
This indicates that 2-0 is not a dangerous scoreline as leading teams are very likely to finish the game with a win.<br/><br/>
Based on the following metrics: Win Rate, % of total goals scored at Home vs Away, Home Expected Goals vs Away Expected Goals, Home Shots vs Away Shots & Home Shots on Target vs Away Shots on Target.<br/>
A team statistically performs better at home.<br/>

### Wrapped in Mystery: Why Drake Always Makes the Cut
**Aim:** <br/>
This project investigates my listening habits and to discover whether Drake truly deserves to be within my top 5 artists each year.<br/><br/>
**Description:**<br/>
This analysis investigates whether Drake truly deserves a spot in the my top 5 Spotify Wrapped artists by comparing Spotifyâ€™s ranking methodology with a customized approach. Additionally, I also investigate the impact of passive vs intentional listening on my Drake listening habits.<br/><br/>
**Technology Stack:**<br/>
SQL, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Excel <br/><br/>
**Key Insights:** <br/>
Across the different methodologies used within the analysis, Drake consistently appears within my Top 5 Artists. However his exact position varies across the different years & differs across the methodology used. Additionally, I also discovered that a significant portion of my Drake listening habits can be attributed to passive listening.<br/><br/>
