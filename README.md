## Projects
Within this section, you can find brief explanation of each project I have worked on along with the technology stack used.

### Beyond the Myths: A Data-Driven Analysis of Common Myths in Football
**Aim:** To investigate whether 2-0 is a dangerous scoreline and to understand whether there is really an advantage playing at home.<br/><br/>
**Description:** This project explores two popular football beliefs: the 'dangerous' nature of a 2-0 scoreline and the concept of home-field advantage. Using data from the last 10 seasons within the Premier League, I aim to uncover the accuracy of these assumptions through data analysis. The analysis of the 2-0 scoreline is primarily completed within Python while the analysis of home field advantage is completed within Power BI. <br/><br/>
**Technology Stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Excel, Power BI <br/><br/>
**Key Insights:** <br/><br/>
**Code:** <br/><br/>
**Dashboard:** <br/><br/>
