# Wrapped in Mystery: Why Drake Always Makes the Cut

## Problem Statement 
There's a few things that are guaranteed in life, death, taxes and Drake being within my spotify wrapped. <br/><br/>
Spotify Wrapped is a yearly wrap up of listening habits that Spotify provide to it's users. This wrap up shows a user's Top 5 Artists, Top 5 Genres, Top 5 Songs and the amount of minutes of Spotify listened to.<br/>
Over the years i've noticed a pattern of Drake appearing in my Top 5 Artists every year despite me not choosing to listen to Drake very often.<br/><br/>
This project attempts to investigate my listening habits and to discover whether Drake truly deserves to be within my top 5 artists each year.
