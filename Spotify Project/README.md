Wrapped in Mystery: Why Drake Always Makes the Cut

There's a few things that are guaranteed in life, death, taxes and Drake being within my spotify wrapped. 
To give extra context Spotify Wrapped is a yearly wrap up of listening habits that Spotify provide to it's users. This wrap up shosw a user's top 5 artists, top 5 genres and the amount of minutes of Spotify listened to.
Over the years i've noticed a pattern of Drake appearing in my top 5 artists every year despite me not choosing to listen to Drake very often.
This project attempts to investigate my listening habits and to discover whether Drake truly deserves to be within my top 5 artists each year.
