# Eben Agati - Data Analyst Portfolio
# About Me

Hello all, my name is Eben Agati. Welcome to my portfolio!
I studied Economics at the University of Nottingham, subsequently after I worked in External Audit for approximately 18 months. After my stint as an auditor I transitioned to a Business Analyst role to which I have been working in the world of Business Analysis since.
Throughout my career I have always loved the data analysis segments of my roles therefore I have decided to create this portfolio in order to showcase my skills, expand and improve my skillset and to derive interesting insights about topics that I love.
